  read the ignore file.
- Add [bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and
  [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) to the pre-commit stack.

## 0.13.1 (2021-10-29)

- Added `is_member` to dataclasses `Workspace` and `Project` to denote whether the user is member of the object.
  Users can now list public workspaces and workspaces, so this flag can indicate the membership.
- Added `permission` to dataclass `Project` to list permissions the user has for ths particular object.
- Added `visibility` to dataclasses `Workspace` and `Project` to indicate whether this is a `PUBLIC` or `PRIVATE`
  workspace or project.

## 0.13.0 (2021-07-29)

- Added `notifications` to dataclasses `Job` and `Project`. We validate whether notifications are setup correctly.
- Introducing `.askannaignore` using the same syntax as `.gitignore` to exclude files from pushing to AskAnna.

## 0.12.2 (2021-07-22)

- Add dataclass `RunStatus` to fix starting a new run

## 0.12.0 (2021-07-08)

- Updated endpoints changes from `/v1/jobrun/` to `/v1/runinfo/`
- We now register an result upload before uploading. This is change required by API `v0.7.0`.
- Updates on the dataclass from `RunInfo` adding fields `environment`, `duration`, `result`, `started`

- We publish our images also on DockerHub starting from now

## 0.11.0 (2021-06-16)

- `track_metric(s)` and `track_variable(s)` now also support date type `list`
- Extended `askanna.runs.get` with the option to filter on `job_name` and to order on `create` date
- When you start a run using the job name via the Python SDK, we now use the project SUUID from the config as a
  default filter.
- If you run a Python script from an AskAnna project directory, we also load the project SUUID in the config.
- Remove deprecated CLI command `askanna artifact add`
- Try to check if an update is available, but don't crash if we cannot run the check

## 0.10.0 (2021-06-03)

- Add functionality to get run results:
  - CLI: `askanna result get`
  - Python SDK: `askanna.result.get()` and `askanna.result.get_content_type()`
- Refactor how we zip artifact paths. The new function fixes an issue with saving individual files. Also, it has some
  built in protection that you cannot zip the full filesystem as an artifact.
- Add run utils function to push the artifact, and prepare for removing `askanna artifact add`

## 0.9.0 (2021-05-19)

- Give runs a name and description when you start them.
  [More info in the documentation.](http://docs.askanna.io/jobs/run-job/)

- Update dataclasses of API responses where we removed the `UUID` and `title`. We now only show the short UUID and
  `name`.
- In API request add `askanna-agent` and `askanna-agent-version` to inform the platform with which tool and version
  the request is done.
- Added a check if a new version of AskAnna is available. For example, if you run `askanna --version` and a new
  version is available, we show an informative message how you can update.
- Removed deprecated functions and files.
- Updated dependencies and removed the superfluous dependency `appdir`.
- Make `askanna variable add` interactive, so you don't have to look-up the project SUUID to add a variable.
- Changing the name of a workspace or project can now also be done via the CLI.
- Install `tzdata` in the default container-image to make it possible to set the time zone of the run environment.
- Fix retrieval of runs with `askanna.run.get` with `include_metrics=True` on.

## 0.8.0 (2021-04-15)
